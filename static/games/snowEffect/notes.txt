move person around by clicking
plant tree or light fire by clicking, but first have to move him there. right click to just move, not plant
need different action system - need click location object which activates when character reaches there, or cancels.
needs to trigger events at that location.  hm.. custom events or some such
also need "health bar" for player


time to make it harder
snow piles still exist under trees - only fire or sun can shrink it
how to do:
  treeGrid probably gets a new instance called snowGrid
  treeGrid will have a lot of null values
  snowflakes have to collide with both but oh well
  need to update & draw both treeGrid and snowGrid
alternately:
  each square of grid can have tree/fire in addition to snowPile
  each interaction calls each function on each subpart as well
  
  
could have sunny time & winter time.  trees only grow (or grow faster) in summer time, and can only be burnt in winter.  then your space gets smaller each winter
could also add costs to planting/growing trees.
could make snow come from different directions
could decrease time fire alive, increase time sapling
could simply have set number trees allowed to plant in summer

have two interesting modes
one where trying to light correct trees on fire and at right times to stay alive (winter)
different tree placements (by developer) can make this more difficult
summer plant trees to prepare for winter

fancy wind direction spawning formula
spawn n flakes along corner
essentially whatever ratio x:y should spawn using total same ratio
x is to y as 4:3 then spawn 4b on x & 3b on y
make x,y into a unit vector
then spawn x(unit vector) on & y (unit vector) on y
if x>y
{
	//should spawn more along horizontal
	//how many more?
	1-y/2x along horizontal
	& y/2x along vertical
}
spawn (1-x/y)*n on x and (x/y)*n on y?
if x/y==0 -x much greater, spawn 100% along right or left side
if x==y (x/y==1), spawn 1/2 each on vertical & horizontal
if y/x==0, spawn 100% along top or bot
